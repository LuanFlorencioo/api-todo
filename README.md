# API Todo

The **Todo App API** is a web application developed with Node.js, Typescript, Express and TypeORM, which offers functionalities to manage tasks. The application has authenticated routes, which guarantee the security of user data.

Through this API, users can **create**, **update**, **list** and **delete** their tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed. The API uses TypeORM to manage the database, which can be configured with different databases supported by TypeORM.

Application routes are protected by **authentication**, using JWT tokens (JSON Web Token) to ensure that only authenticated users can access them. Authentication is done through a login system, where the user must provide their credentials (nickname and password) to obtain a valid JWT token.
